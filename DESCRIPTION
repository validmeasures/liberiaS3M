Description: The Simple Spatial Survey Method (S3M) was developed from the CSAS 
    coverage survey method as a response to the widespread adoption of community 
    management of acute malnutrition (CMAM) by ministries of health. Large-scale 
    programs need a large-scale survey method and S3M was developed to meet that 
    need.
