# The first stage sample {#stage1}

## Step 1: Find a map

```{r smallScaleMap, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.cap = "Small scale map of Liberia showing counties and settlements", fig.align = "center", fig.width = 10, fig.height = 10, fig.pos = "H", fig.retina = 1}
sp::plot(liberia::settlements, pch = 20, cex = 0.3, col = "gray70")
sp::plot(liberia::counties, lwd = 2, border = "gray50", add = TRUE)
```

The first step in an S3M survey is to find a map of the survey area.

Try to find a map showing the locations of all towns and villages in the survey area. You may need to update the map to take into account migration and displacement.

If you are surveying a very large area then you will find it useful to have:

* A small scale map of the entire survey area. This map does not need to show the location of all towns and villages in survey area.

* A collection of larger scale maps showing the locations of all towns and villages. This collection of maps should cover the entire survey area.

The small scale map will be useful for identifying initial sampling locations.

The large scale maps will be useful for identifying the precise locations of sampling points and for selecting the communities to be sampled.
