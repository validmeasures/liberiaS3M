# The second stage sample {#stage2}

## Step 10: Within-community sampling

The sampling process that you use to select a sample from a community will depend on what the survey is investigating.

If you are investigating multiple indicators which apply to different groups of individuals then you may find it easier to use different sampling methods for different indicators. You can think of this as having different surveys for different indicators sampled from the same set of communities at the same time. For the Liberia S3M, this is the approach that will be used. There will be a survey for CMAM coverage, a survey for children under 60 months, a survey for children under 24 months and a survey for pregnant and lactating women.

For the survey for CMAM coverage, an active and adaptive (snowball) case-finding method will be used in stage 2 sampling to find all or nearly all of SAM cases in the stage 1 sample. 

For the under 60 months and under 24 months sample, this can be implemented in a single survey in such a way that a large enough under 60 months children are sampled to provide the minimum sample size needed for the under 24 months survey.

For the survey for pregnant and lactating women, this can be approached in a couple of ways. The standard approach to evaluating such indicators is to sample women with children less than 24 months. The expectation here is that these women are meant to be lactating given their child's age. At the same time, they have been recently pregnant (within the last 2 years) such that they will be able to recall their pregnancy experience and be able to report whether or not they benefitted from ferrous sulfate-folic acid supplementation during their latest pregnancy. The more complicated approach is to further subdivide this sample to lactating women (those with children under 24 months old) to assess the IYCF counselling coverage and then to find all or nearly all currently pregnant women to ask them about their ferrous sulfate and folic acid supplementation status. Either approaches will have their limitations. The main drawback with the second approach is that the amount of currently pregnant women at any given time is relatively small (on average about 4 in a village of about 200 population). So, finding enough sample of pregnant women will always be a challenge. This is the main reason why standard surveys such as DHS and MICS use the first approach but with women with children less than 60 months (longer recall which is problematic).

The most practical stage 2 sample for the Liberia S3M will be a survey specific for the CMAM coverage in which a part of the survey team will apply active and adaptive case finding in about 3-5 villages nearest to the chosen sampling point in stage 1. This is done so as to get enough sample of SAM cases for estimation. This CMAM coverage survey will then be nested within an overarching survey of mothers with children under 60 months to assess all other indicators (of the child and of the mother). This is the most efficient and robust approach given the indicator set required.
