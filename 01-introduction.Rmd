# Introduction {#introduction}

The Simple Spatial Survey Method (S3M) was developed from the CSAS coverage survey method as a response to the widespread adoption of community management of acute malnutrition (CMAM) by ministries of health. Large-scale programs need a large-scale survey method and S3M was developed to meet that need.

S3M was designed to :

* Be simple enough for MoH, NGO, and UNO personnel without specialist statistical training to perform.

* Provide a general survey method. S3M can be used to survey and map :

    * Need for and coverage of selective-entry programs such as CMAM and TSFP as well as universal programs such as EPI, GMP, GFD (general ration), and “blanket” SFP over wide areas.

    * Levels of indicators such as those for IYCF, WASH, and period prevalence / cumulative prevalence of ARI, fever, and diarrhoea over wide areas.

This document concentrates on using S3M to assess the need for and coverage of:

* Treatment of SAM in children aged between 6 and 59 months;

* Vitamin A supplementation;

* Micronutrient powder supplementation;

* Ferrous sulphate-folic acid supplementation; and,

* Infant and young child feeding counselling.
